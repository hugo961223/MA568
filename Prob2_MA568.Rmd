#### 1.Download and load M1_spikes.csv & Create variables :T, X, Y, V, phi, spiketimes, Spikes.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
M1_spikes <- read.csv("C:/Users/hugo1/Documents/MA568/M1_spikes.csv")
# load the csv file

T <- M1_spikes$T 
X <- M1_spikes$X
Y <- M1_spikes$Y
V <- M1_spikes$V
phi <- M1_spikes$phi
spiketimes <- subset(M1_spikes, spikes == 1, select = T)[,1]
spikes <- M1_spikes$spikes
# create variables

hist(spiketimes, breaks = seq(1, 8200, 1), xlab = 'Time', ylab = '', main = 'Spiking activity as time series')
# plot the spiking activity as a time series

plot(x = X, y = Y, type = 'l')

points(x = subset(M1_spikes, spikes == 1, select = X)[,1], y = subset(M1_spikes, spikes == 1, select = Y)[,1], col = 'red', pch = 19)
